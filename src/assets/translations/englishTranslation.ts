However, if you are going on an exotic trip once in a while (up to 30 days), we suggest taking out the single trip option. \n\nWhen you are planning a trip to one of the countries in Europe, you are covered by the European Health Insurance Programme. By having a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), you are entitled to receive basic emergency care in the country you are in. However, most tourist organisations and offices advise to take out additional insurance to cover non-medical emergencies, such as cancellation of flights or loss of luggage. Moreover, the EHIC card only covers countries within the European Union, which is why Travel Insurance is necessary when planning a trip outside of Europe. \n\nThe costs of such insurance are quite low (around £30). The costs vary depending on the number of people traveling, destination and length of stay. Usually, you can purchase travel insurance over the phone, which will take around 10 minutes. \n\nFeel free to contact us at 07522345476 to find out more.",

          'A trust is a so-called trust document. Colloquially, to understand its essence, we say that it is a "will" for a life insurance policy. Preparing it gives us the certainty that the money from our policy will go to the right hands. Thanks to it, we can also avoid paying unnecessary taxes.',
        mainText:
          "Let's start from the beginning. We take out life insurance. The policy is concluded correctly and the insurance company pays the insured amount. If there is no Trust attached to the policy, then the amount from the payout is added to the deceased's estate. To gain access to the estate of a deceased person, you need the so-called probate, and this may take up to several months. When the estate exceeds £325,000, our loved ones will have to pay inheritance tax at the rate of 40%. The lack of a trust document also means that standard inheritance law applies when it comes to the division of property. Therefore, the spouse receives the first £250,000 and half of the remaining amount. Children, however, receive the second half of the amount, after deducting the first £250,000. \n\nTo speed up the payment from the policy, each of us should have a Trust established. This will mean that the policy will be excluded from the deceased's estate and access to the money will be granted much faster. People who should especially make sure that they have such a document include: couples living in informal relationships, people with significant assets, single people, people whose partners live outside the UK, and people who want to exclude specific people from inheriting their property. This also applies to single mothers or fathers, as well as parents who want to specify that only minor children are to be heirs. \n\nWhen completing the Trust, we will be asked to indicate the trustee and the beneficiary. The trustee's job is to make sure the policy money goes to the right person, and the beneficiary is the person who can use the money in any way they want. \n\n\nIf you are not sure whether a Trust was established when your policy was concluded, please contact us on 07858282317.",

        mainText:
          "Firstly, there are many professions in the UK, which require professional insurance and it is illegal to trade without it. Hence, it is important to check with your accountant, if you need the essential cover for your business. If you do, Clover can help to find the most competitive offer for you! \n\nSecondly, insuring your company means you can rest assured and focus on building your business, instead of worrying about potential consequences of unfortunate events. There are many different options of insuring what you do, from protecting you in case of a theft, through accidents on site, to protecting your income when unable to work. Every business owner knows that establishing your own company requires endless amounts of work, including thinking about ways to grow your business every minute of your day. Insurance takes a lot of burden off your shoulders, which means you can focus on the important stuff. Accidents, theft and many other unexpected events happen and will keep happening, because people are a big part of each business. People are not perfect and will most likely make mistakes. Taking a pragmatic approach to business, means protecting yourself, as well as your employees. \n\nBy losing all your capital due to poor business protection, you also lose many years of hard work. Of course, you can start over after a setback, but it can be difficult. This is why Clover offers less painful solutions. If you are running a business, get in touch to obtain a quote, as business protection is generally inexpensive. It is always better to be safe than sorry.",
