In such circumstances, the Company will advise You accordingly. \nThe Company will also provide You with information relevant to Your mortgage/home finance/insurance needs, covering such items as an explanation of the main repayment methods and the implications of taking out a mortgage. All advice given and recommendations made, including the underlying reasoning will be confirmed to You in a Suitability Report. \nIt should be noted that it is your duty to report all information that could be considered a material fact in relation to the insurance contract you have proposed. In addition, you should read carefully the policy wording (once received) and familiarise yourself with any further requirements to inform the insurer about a fact that might have an effect on the policy in the future. Failure to disclosure such material facts may render the insurance invalid and will therefore not provide the cover you expect.",
